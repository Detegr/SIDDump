Modified version of [SIDDump](http://cadaver.homeftp.net/tools.htm) that dumps the SID writes into stdout.
Honestly, it's been a while since I hacked this up and I don't remember much of the code. Especially it seems odd that I've commented out passband and mastervolume, but well, this is what I used.
